# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze PyBer ride sharing data to understand ridership and fare by city, while creating visuals of rideshare data for Pyber. In order to assist PyBer and improve their serices, overall cost and affordability for underserved areas needed to be assessed.
### Data
Data presented includes ride and city data by area in order to better analyze PyBer rideshare data.
## Results and Analysis
Utilizing Python and CSV through our data set, we determined the following:
 1. Urban cities have highest ridership, while rural cities have the least.
 2. Urban cities have 4x as many drivers than suburban areas.
 3. Suburban cities have 6x the drivers than rural.
 4. Suburban areas have 4.5x the revenue of rural cities.
 5. Results indicate that fare revenue is higher when there is a higher ratio of drivers to rides.

## Summary
### To the CEO

Overall, the use of this data can be very helpful for future PyBer developments. I would recommend the following changes be made:
1. Increase drivers in rural areas to further demand and scale up PyBer in the future
2. Provide incentive to drivers in rural areas to increase demand- this will help with potential revenue loss during peaks in ridership due to longer distance rides with fewer drivers
3. Advertise and hold focus groups in both rural and urban areas to determine pain points and decrease frustration among customers due to average fares

PyBer has growth potential to succeed, and by listening to customer wants and needs, including establishing relationships in rural areas, this will help improve the business overall.
